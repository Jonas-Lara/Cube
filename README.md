# Cube

## In this project I port [servetgulnaroglu's](https://github.com/servetgulnaroglu/cube.c) Cube code originally written in C to C++, C# and F#


### 1) Understand and rewrite the C code to C++ to C# and finally to F#.

- **Understand the code in C**
- **Rewrite the code in C++** 
- **Rewrite the C++ code to C#** 
- **Rewrite the C# code to F# with several changes to make it more functional**

### 2) Migrate the code to WASM, I have two options

- Compile C/C++ code to wasm with [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/)
- Compile C# code to wasm with [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor)

### 3) Create a web page to show the cube

- Deploy in GitHub Pages
